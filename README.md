# Pokemon-Quiz-Game-old. 

A pokemon quiz game I made when I frst started learning JS. 
A random pokemons shadow is displayed and the audio plays "whos that pokemon" as happens in the commercial break. The background is an animated video to simulate the same as the TV show.
The person types letters to try to get the corrent pokemon name.  If they press 3 incorrect letters then the game ends.
